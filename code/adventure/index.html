  <h4> There is a train hurtling down the tracks. Its brakes have been disengaged. There is no way to fix the brakes and there is a fork in the tracks. On one track there are five drunks. If the train goes down that path they will die. On the other track there are two construction workers fixing the track. If you pull a lever you put the train onto the track where the construction workers are working unassumingly.This will kill them but save the five drunks. What do you do? </h4>
