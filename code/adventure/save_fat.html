  <h4> Congrats! You saved the fat man! However, there is still one last thing you can do to save the others. The fat man is standing on a trap door. There is a lever that will release this door and the man will fall to his death, stopping the train and saving the five drunks. Remember when answering that the fat man is more prone to health issues while the five young drunks have long lives ahead of them if they kick their drinking habits.   </h4>
